The following resources are organized under the "program codes and supplementary" section:

### Files and Scripts
- **GroupingImage.py**  
  Group images into ten folders based on classification.

- **Step1ExtractRGB.py**  
  Extract RGB values from images.

- **finetune_exp2.jsonl**  
  Training data for fine-tuning in Task 2 (`.jsonl` format).

### Folders
- **Task1 and Task2**  
  Process MLLM results and calculate errors or accuracy for graphical perception tasks.

- **Visualization**  
  Visualize the prediction results.

- **participant_recall_responses**
