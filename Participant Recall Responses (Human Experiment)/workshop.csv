G1,"Three steps: Compare the overall color blocks, compare with the surrounding color blocks, and confirm.",Focus on the legend and surrounding color blocks. Distinguish colors and observe the target area in relation to its surroundings.,Able to distinguish between the target area and its surroundings.,"1. It is difficult to recognize the Blues (singlehue) Task 2, sometimes the degree of variation is difficult to compare, and there is no surrounding area available for reference.",P1 P2 P3 P4,
G2,Five steps: 1. Read the question and understand the requirements; 2. Identify the key elements of the question; 3. Extract these elements from the image; 4. Quantify them using the color legend; 5. Compare trends or numerical values to make a decision.,Key considerations include the relationship between colors and numerical values. Focus on the information conveyed by different colors and the legend.,Necessary knowledge: Analyze the problem and summarize the thought process.,"1. Blue-yellow (gray, blue);
2. Task 3; Some trends are relatively small, making them difficult to distinguish.",P5 P6 P7 P8,
G3,"1. Find extreme values and numerical differences; 2. Locate areas with large gradients and peak values; 3. When it is difficult to distinguish, use details to perform weighted averaging; if the extreme differences are close, find the intermediate values relative to the extremes.",Identify extreme points; 2. Identify points with major changes.,It is necessary to convert colors into numerical values.,"1. Gray;
2. Task 3 requires more attention to details, and the process of converting colors into numerical values demands more cognitive effort.",P9 P10 P11,
G4,"First, observe the legend: check the highest and lowest points, determine which values are higher or lower, and estimate the color corresponding to the intermediate value. Second, look at the scalar field on the left side and find the answer.",Use the legend and scalar field diagram for reference.,Distinguish colors clearly and accurately interpret the numerical values on the legend.,"Task 3 is the most difficult, while Task 2 is the easiest. In Task 3, the color differences in the images are small, and the colors are similar, making them difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, the degree of variation is limited, and the distance between the images and the curves is relatively large, introducing greater errors during comparisons.",P12 P13 P14 P15,
G5,"Experiment 1: Read the question, compare the data, and find the color blocks from light to dark.
Experiment 2: Read the question, first check if there are large areas of color blocks, find the two colors with the greatest differences, compare the proportion of each color, and note that sudden changes in color will make observers perceive a greater steepness.
Experiment 3: Read the question, first observe the color data at points A and B to determine if there is a significant difference between them, then check if there is a color gradient along the line connecting A and B, identify where the change occurs, plot the color data curve accordingly, and compare it with the curves given in the question to select the most suitable one.",Pay attention to color thresholds and the range of variation.,Judging colors accurately is essential.,"Experiment 3 feels more difficult because it requires judging the values of all pixel points between two locations. (Although knowing a few values might help in making a choice, it still feels hard to select correctly.) Especially for very subtle variations, it was difficult to accurately judge them with the naked eye, even though the curve was drawn that way.",P16 P17 P18,
