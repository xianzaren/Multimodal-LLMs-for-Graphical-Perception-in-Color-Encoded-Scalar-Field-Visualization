2,2025/3/8 16:53:58,P1,20,Computer Science,"First look at the coordinates, then find points from light to dark in the image.","When seeing dark colors in the middle of a square, you will feel a greater difference from the surrounding colors and choose that square. If the gradient is smooth, it will feel softer.",,,,,,,,,,,
3,2025/3/8 16:56:39,P2,18,Computer Science,1. Compare the overall brightness of colors; 2. Compare with surrounding color blocks; 3. Confirm the selected area; 4. Repeat comparisons to complete selection.,Roughly compare the degree of change from the outside to the center; separately find and compare the path with the most drastic change in the square.,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2025/3/8 16:57:54,P3,19,Biology Science,"1. Observe the overall image, choose the lightest point; 2. Select a small area range and set a linear area from light to dark; 3. Observe the legend on the right and carefully compare colors; 4. Select the point.","First observe the color at the boundary (0.5) on the right color bar; roughly observe the variety of colors inside the square; the more color types, the steeper the gradient.",,,,,,,,,,,
5,2025/3/8 17:01:41,P4,19,Computer Science,1. Look at the legend on the right to find corresponding colors; 2. Find matching colors in the scalar field on the left by comparing with surrounding colors; 3. Repeat to select five points.,"First look at the color scale on the right, noting that the colors change from purple to blue to light green to red; in the square, first find red and purple. If both exist, the change is more drastic. If not, find red and blue, or red and light green, and gradually narrow the range.",,,,,,,,,,,
6,2025/3/8 17:03:17,P5,19,Biology Science,"1. Identify easily distinguishable extreme points (e.g., 1000 and 0); 2. Segment and find critical values like 750 close to 1000, then find nearby points.","Find the extreme colors in the square and compare them with the scale on the right, recording the value differences; compare the differences in extreme color values between two squares; if the differences are small, compare the mid-range color gradients by recording the differences between intermediate and extreme colors.",,,,,,,,,,,
7,2025/3/8 17:04:39,P6,21,Biology Science,"Except for the first and last points which are easiest to judge by brightness, other points are at the transition between lighter and darker areas; find points matching the legend at the boundary.","First identify the highest and lowest colors in the scale contained in the square to determine the range of color change—the larger the range, the steeper the gradient. When two squares have similar color change ranges, compare the distribution areas of the two end colors—more distribution at the ends and less in the middle indicates a steeper gradient.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,2025/3/8 17:05:32,P7,19,Computer Science,"1. I first looked at the standard, identified that the scale marks indicated finding five colors from light to dark 2. Compared colors roughly mapping them to white, yellow, orange, red, black 3. Located the easiest white area first, then found matching yellows and so on 4. Repeated to find all points 5. Switched to grayscale image and focused more on contrast.","First, observe the overall color proportion in the square. If most of the square is a single color, the gradient will not be steep. If two squares have similar color proportions, check which one has a richer variety of colors—more colors mean a steeper gradient. Compare the biggest color contrast within a square—the larger the contrast between warm and cool colors, the steeper the gradient.",,,,,,,,,,,
9,2025/3/8 17:05:42,P8,19,Computer Science,"1. First find the brightest (white) areas; 2. For other points, use a gradual approximation method because boundaries are not obvious; compare across boundaries and finalize.","First find the maximum and minimum values in the square; judge the size of the boundary between different color regions and whether the color change is sharp. Use the analogy of topographic maps: green as the baseline, red as peaks, blue as valleys, and infer the slope.",,,,,,,,,,,
10,2025/3/8 17:06:28,P9,19,Biology Science,"1. I saw the 'color-number' correspondence chart on the right, found 1000 as the darkest, 0 as the lightest. 2. Easily located darkest and lightest points. 3. Moved slightly from 1000 to find depth close to 750 for point 2. 4. Found midpoints by feeling when no clear reference.","I mainly judge the color range within the square. For example, in task 10, the darkest color value of the black square is close to 0, and the brightest is close to 0.99, while the brightest value in the white square is only around 0.8. Thus, I believe the black square has a steeper color gradient. My judgment relies on instant memory and visual perception of the color scale.",,,,,,,,,,,
11,2025/3/8 17:06:31,P10,20,Biology Science,"1. Identifying the whitest part is easy; 2. For 0.75 points, yellow in color, light gray in grayscale; 3. 0.5 is orange/mid-gray; 4. 0.25 similarly by color comparison; 5. 0 and 1 are easy to find as pure white and black.","Based on the following judgment criteria: The greater the color span, the steeper the gradient. A color transition from red to blue has a steeper gradient than from red to green or purple to green. Based on color extremities. If bright red and deep purple appear in one image but not the other, the one reaching extremities has a steeper gradient. Compare small areas within the square. If a small region shows a significant color jump, such as from red to blue in a small area, the gradient is steeper.",,,,,,,,,,,
12,2025/3/8 17:06:45,P11,19,Computer Science,"1. Find extreme points 0 and 1.0; 2. Other points: find distinct colors like orange and yellow in the color image; in grayscale, locate similar brightness regions near edges.","In most cases, the two squares have obvious differences (similar upper limits but different lower limits: one blue, one purple; or vice versa). For extreme colors (purple-red), the difference is not very noticeable (I basically can't tell).",,,,,,,,,,,
13,2025/3/8 17:06:55,P12,20,Biology Science,"First observe the color order, realize it goes from light to dark; then based on the legend identify corresponding areas; locate the lightest white area, then sequentially find matching colors until the darkest.",Find several color changes according to the color scale; compare the general color distribution between the black and white squares; match these colors to intervals on the right; subtract the interval values and compare—larger differences indicate steeper color changes.,,,,,,,,,,,
14,2025/3/8 17:08:55,P13,18,Computer Science,1. Find the brightest spot; 2. Find darker areas near the brightest spot; 3. Find a third point with tone clearly different from the first and last; 4. Locate transitional colors; 5. Find the darkest point.,"Prioritize based on tone change; when the color gradients seem similar, the square with more dark areas usually has a steeper gradient; if the proportion of dark areas is similar, the square with dark areas closer to the center has a steeper gradient.",,,,,,,,,,,
15,2025/3/8 17:08:59,P14,18,Computer Science,"1. Find the highest value point in areas with clear color gradients; 2. Find points near boundaries at 750, 500, 250; 3.

16,2025/3/8 17:12:22,P15,18,Computer Science,"Two steps: 1. Match numeric values with colors on the right legend; 2. Find matching colors on the left scalar field, continuously comparing selected points to standard legend.","First observe which square has more color types—the one with more colors generally has a steeper gradient. If both squares have roughly the same variety, connect the highest and lowest values (assuming similar differences) and compare the line lengths—the shorter the line, the steeper the gradient. If still unsure, find the region where color changes are most concentrated, connect points with the same difference (larger differences preferred), and compare line lengths.",,,,,,,,,,,
17,2025/3/8 17:13:06,P16,19,Computer Science,"1. The experiment requires identifying five distinct colors; 1 and 5 are the extreme colors, easy to find; 2.

18,2025/3/8 17:13:07,P17,19,Computer Science,"1. Find intervals corresponding to 1000 and 0; 2. Find relatively uniform transition regions; if available, pick three points close to expectation; otherwise, find regions with large contrast range.","Observe the color scale to determine values corresponding to colors (typically 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1); check if the square contains colors close to 0 and 1; if found, continue; if not, determine the approximate range. Compare the maximum and minimum values in the images—if one extreme is close, base the judgment on the other.",,,,,,,,,,,
